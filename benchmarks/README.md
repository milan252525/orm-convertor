Visual Studio projects containing unit and benchmark tests for 7 different .NET ORMs.

Visual Studio Test Explorer window can be used to run unit tests.

To run performance benchmarks, set `BenchmarkMain` as a startup project. Configuration must be set to `Release`. Then start the project without debugging (CTRL + F5). A console window will appear. It contains instructions on how to target specific benchmarks. To run all, type in an asterisk (*) and press enter. This will trigger a full run, which takes approximately one hour to finish. You can switch to the test configuration which does only a few numbers of iterations in `BenchmarkMain/Program.cs` file. 

Console command for running benchmarks is `dotnet run --configuration Release --project BenchmarkMain\BenchmarkMain.csproj`. To run with a shorter test configuration, append `-- --testb` at the end of the command.

Tests will not execute without a database running locally. The instructions to start an instance are below.

# Database setup
Dockerfile is provided to initialize Microsoft SQL Server database and fill it with data. Tested using Podman and Docker.

Build image:
`podman build -t orm-comparison .`

Run container: 
`podman run -d --name orm-comparison -p 1444:1433 orm-comparison`

Test connection:
`sqlcmd -S 127.0.0.1,1444 -U SA -P Testingorms123 -Q "SELECT * FROM [WideWorldImporters].[Purchasing].[PurchaseOrders]"`
