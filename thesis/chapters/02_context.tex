\chapter{Analysis of ORM frameworks}
\label{chapter:ormcomparison}

We will start by exploring what Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks are. We will introduce core concepts in relation to the .NET framework. After looking at modern trends and available ORMs, we will choose a representative sample. We will look at the candidates and analyze their features, strengths, and limitations. After we have a good theoretical understanding, we will practically verify capabilities and prepare performance benchmarks on a set of pre-selected queries. We will build upon this knowledge to design translation between different ORMs in the subsequent chapters.
