\chapter{Analysis of ORM frameworks}
\label{chapter:ormcomparison}

We will start by exploring what \acrshort{orm} frameworks are. We will introduce core concepts in relation to the .NET framework. After looking at modern trends and available \acrshort{orm}(s), we will choose a representative sample. We will look at the candidates and analyze their features, strengths, and limitations. After we have a good theoretical understanding, we will practically verify capabilities and prepare performance benchmarks on a set of pre-selected queries. We will build upon this knowledge to design translation between different \acrshort{orm}(s) in the subsequent chapters.
