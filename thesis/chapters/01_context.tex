\chapter{Analysis of .NET ORM frameworks}
\label{chapter:ormcomparison}

The chapter begins by exploring what \acrshort{orm} frameworks are, introducing core concepts in relation to the .NET framework. Modern trends and available \acrshort{orm}(s) are then reviewed, followed by the selection of a representative sample. The chosen candidates are analyzed in terms of their features, strengths, and limitations. Once a solid theoretical foundation is established, practical capabilities are verified and performance benchmarks are prepared using a set of pre-selected queries. This knowledge serves as the basis for designing translation between different \acrshort{orm}(s) in the subsequent chapters.
